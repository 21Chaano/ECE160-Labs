# Lab Solutions for ECE160 Lab Course

## Solutions written by Chansen Tano for ECE160-Fall 2024
### Repository will be made private at the end of the semester

In this repository are the lab solutions for the lab assignments.

I have written these solutions myself and included comments in most of the solutions that explain what the code does and other things to keep in mind.
Note that not all solutions have been written for lab 1 as I felt that these modules were very beginner, and that it would be more worth your while to see the harder stuff.
The solutions that ZyBooks has written will also be released but they tend to lack comments that explain the code.

I will be releasing lab solutions the weekend before your midterms or exams so that you may choose to study them.


### Traversing the Repository
To find the lab solutions, simply click on the directory (folders) of the different labs to view the files inside.
I tried to name the files as close to the contents of the code and to the corresponding module in ZyBooks as possible.
If you don't remember which lab a module came from, you can cross reference with your ZyBooks assignment list.
